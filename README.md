I have been working in the IT industry for the last 4 years were I primarily worked with PHP(Laravel) , and Angular .
I have also spent some time developing android Apps on a professional level.I Really enjoyed working with golang during the development of this small project and hope to do it again.
I'm also a big fan of linux and opensource, I do have hands on real experience in linux as during my last job it was my responsibility to mange and overlook various linux VPSes.
